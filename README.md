# Eye_Clinic-Inventory-Recommendation
An eye clinic does eye check-ups and gives the appropriate lenses on the spot after the check-up. Just like what Lenscart do but with on-spot delivery. Few people are unable to take use of this facility as there is a previously defined inventory of different lenses and this gets over. Now clinic wants to optimize its inventory, so that it can minimise the patients that are unable to receive the on-spot delivery. Consider yourself to be the in charge of the inventory and suggest some recommendation of the inventory numbers.
